Lab 4

Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.

Question 1.1 
Advantages: Generates working software quickly and early during the coding development
Easier to test and debug during a smaller iteration. 
Each iteration is an easily managed milestone

Question 2.1 
It supposed to give minimum value in each sequence 

Question 2.2 
Min value for an empty array list -> 2147483647 

Question 3.1 
It supposed to give the values larger than threshold value for each sequence.

Question 3.2 
test3.in is created as an empty sequence thus the program generates an empty sequence for this test case. 

Question 4.1 
Any input stream that is not integer
On windows press Ctrl + Z
On Linux/Unix press Ctrl + D

Question 4.2
(nums.valuesGT(...)).printVals();
The very last one gets executed once the expression inside the parenthesis gets evaluated first.

Question 4.3 
Nums

Question 4.4 
Nums temp = new Nums();
temp = nums.valuesGT(threshold);
temp.printVals;

Question 4.5 & 4.6 
ArrayList is variable length, meaning it's resizable. 
Takes longer time for data entry. Takes more memory.

Question 4.7
1. Not necessarily. 
2. No. Unneccessary. 
3. Again, not necessarily. 
4. No. A loop will be sufficient to complete the task. 
5. Yes. A sequence needs to be stored beforehand.
6. Yes. As why we need to code Num class.
