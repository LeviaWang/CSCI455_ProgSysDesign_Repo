CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1. According to the Syllabus, "The outside code resources students will be
allowed to use in assignments for this class are limited to code written by the course staff
for the purposes of helping students in the course, or code from the textbook for this
course. If you do use any such code not written by you, you are required to acknowledge
your sources in your README file. If you have questions about what is allowed, please
discuss it with the instructor."

2. Ideally it should be 25%, 25%, and 50% for Two heads, Two tails, and one head and one tail. The outcome is calculated by binomial probability formula, thus explains why one head and one tail is 50% instead. 

3. Around 2000 trials will be enough to have outcome within 1% range. 

4. numTrials is an int primitive variable and int is 4 byte which is around +/- 2 billion. Once the numTrials value is higher than 4 byte (2 billion) then the program may crash.
